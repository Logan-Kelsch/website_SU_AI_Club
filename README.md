# AI Life Hub

A small React + Vite app you can run locally with `npm`.
It has a **Sign In** landing page (accepts any input), a **Dashboard** with three major categories:
- **AI Therapy** (Mental)
- **Workouts** (Physical)
- **Budgeting** (Financial)

Each category has a **Credits** section (put names by hand later) and **Attribute #n** placeholder pages that you can flesh out later.

It also includes a **Settings** page for **Light/Dark** theme and customizable **accent color** (defaults to a sage green).

## Run locally

```bash
cd ai-life-hub
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit the printed local URL in your browser (typically http://localhost:5173).

## Build for production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```
